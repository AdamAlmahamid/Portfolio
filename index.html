        <h1>Some information about me</h1>
        <hr>
        <h2>Basic Introduction</h2>
        <p>My name is Adam. I grew up in Switzerland. I like sports in general, video games, and chess (even though I am mediocre at it). In general, I enjoy trying out new things. I tried coding last summer where I attempted to code a video game using Unity.</p>
        <h3>Some things that made me happy last couple of days</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Switzerland beating France in the Euro</li>
            <li>Seeing progress in my coding knowledge</li>
            <li>Noticing that I've still got two months of Summer Vacation</li>
        </ul>
