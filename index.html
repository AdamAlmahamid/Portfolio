        <h3>Basic Introduction</h3>
        <p>My name is Adam, I am 17 and I grew up in Switzerland. My first language is french and I've been learning english for the last 4 years. In general, I enjoy trying out new things. I mainly play basketball, but I also like playing soccer or football. I tried coding last summer where I attempted to code a video game using Unity.</p>
        <p>I have a cat and her name's kiri. Here's a picture of her. </p>

        <p>I rarely take pictures of myself or pictures of things around me, but this is a picture of myself to show that I am able to add an image using html.</p>
